<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Delta-T is a fast performance check, not a standalone diagnosis.</p>

<h4>What Delta-T Is</h4>
<p><strong>Cooling Delta-T = Return Air Dry Bulb - Supply Air Dry Bulb</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heating Delta-T = Supply Air Dry Bulb - Return Air Dry Bulb</strong></p>

<h4>Field Procedure (Cooling Mode)</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Set thermostat to call for cooling and let system run <strong>10–15 minutes</strong> to stabilize.</li>
    <li>Confirm basics first: clean filter, blower running, coil not visibly iced, all major registers open.</li>
    <li>Measure <strong>return air dry bulb</strong> at return grille or return plenum (avoid attic air influence).</li>
    <li>Measure <strong>supply air dry bulb</strong> a few feet downstream of coil (or nearest main supply trunk).</li>
    <li>Calculate: <strong>Delta-T = Return - Supply</strong>.</li>
    <li>Record outdoor temp, indoor temp/humidity, static pressure, and Delta-T together for context.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Quick Interpretation (Cooling)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>~16–22°F:</strong> Common range on many properly operating systems under typical load.</li>
    <li><strong>Low Delta-T (&lt;~16°F):</strong> Often high airflow, low charge, duct leakage, high latent load, or
        mixed air issues.</li>
    <li><strong>High Delta-T (&gt;~22°F):</strong> Often low airflow (dirty filter/coil, blower issues, duct
        restriction) or low indoor load.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
    Manufacturer airflow and charging targets override generic ranges. Use Delta-T as a screening KPI, not final proof.
</p>

<h4>How-To Workflow (No Guessing)</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1: Airflow first.</strong> Check filter, blower speed/tap, wheel cleanliness, evaporator condition,
        and TESP.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2: Refrigerant second.</strong> Verify charge by SH/SC method matched to metering device.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3: Envelope/load context.</strong> Check doors/windows, duct leakage, return infiltration, indoor
        RH.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4: Re-test and trend.</strong> Capture before/after Delta-T and include in job notes/photos.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Quick Tips (Veteran + New Tech)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>same measurement locations</strong> every visit for apples-to-apples trend data.</li>
    <li>Don’t read right off the coil face or at one supply register only—use representative points.</li>
    <li>If humidity is high, sensible split can look lower even when system is doing real latent work.</li>
    <li>Pair Delta-T with <strong>static pressure + SH/SC + amp draw</strong> before quoting major repairs.</li>
    <li>After any adjustment (charge/airflow), allow stabilization before taking final readings.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Diagnosing refrigerant issues from Delta-T alone.</li>
    <li>Skipping airflow verification before charging adjustments.</li>
    <li>Taking readings too early (no stabilization time).</li>
    <li>Using different probe locations each time and comparing as if trend data is valid.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
    Closeout standard: log Delta-T with return/supply temps, ambient, static, and charging metrics. That’s defensible
    diagnostics.
