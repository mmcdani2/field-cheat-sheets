<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Diagnose electrical failures with meter data, not guesswork. This is the fastest path to
    fewer callbacks and cleaner closeout notes.</p>

<h4>Safety First (Non-Negotiable)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Lockout/tagout where required.</li>
    <li>Verify meter operation on known live source before and after testing.</li>
    <li>Discharge capacitors safely before capacitance checks.</li>
    <li>Use proper PPE and one-hand rule where applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Core Electrical Workflow (Any No-Cool / No-Heat Call)</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Confirm call:</strong> Thermostat demand present (Y, G, W, O/B as applicable).</li>
    <li><strong>Confirm high voltage:</strong> Line voltage at disconnect, contactor line side, and equipment lugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirm control voltage:</strong> 24V path through safeties and board outputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Test components:</strong> Capacitor, contactor coil/contacts, motors, board outputs, safeties.</li>
    <li><strong>Validate result:</strong> Re-run system and capture amps/voltage/temps after repair.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Capacitor How-To</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Power off and verify zero volts.</li>
    <li>Discharge capacitor safely.</li>
    <li>Remove at least one lead to avoid backfeed reading.</li>
    <li>Measure µF (C-FAN and C-HERM on dual cap).</li>
    <li>Compare to label value and tolerance; replace if out.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">If a capacitor failed, inspect motor amp draw and condenser cleanliness so the new one doesn’t fail
    again.</p>

<h4>Contactor How-To</h4>
<ol>
    <li>On call, verify 24V across coil terminals.</li>
    <li>If coil energizes, check line/load voltage and contact condition.</li>
    <li>Measure voltage drop across closed contacts; high drop = resistance/heat risk.</li>
    <li>Inspect for ants/debris/pitting/welded contacts.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Motor Diagnostics (Condenser Fan / Blower)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Verify commanded voltage at motor terminals.</li>
    <li>Check capacitor (PSC) or module/control signal (ECM).</li>
    <li>Compare running amps to nameplate context (FLA/RLA where applicable).</li>
    <li>Inspect for mechanical drag: blade rub, tight bearings, wheel debris, high static.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Control Voltage Fault Isolation (24V)</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Start at transformer secondary (~24V).</li>
    <li>Trace through thermostat call and safety chain.</li>
    <li>Find where voltage is lost (open switch, broken wire, failed board relay).</li>
    <li>Repair cause, then re-test full sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">Best practice: “Last good point / first bad point” method. It is fast and defensible.</p>

<h4>Common Patterns and Likely Causes</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Outdoor dead, indoor blower runs:</strong> open contactor coil circuit, float switch, pressure switch,
        board output, or disconnect issue.</li>
    <li><strong>Contactor chatters:</strong> weak low-voltage supply, loose connections, failing transformer,
        thermostat/control issue.</li>
    <li><strong>Breaker trips on startup:</strong> short to ground, locked rotor, failed compressor, pinched wiring,
        failed capacitor/start components.</li>
    <li><strong>Burned wire terminals:</strong> loose lugs/high resistance heating—repair terminal and root-cause
        current draw.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Quick Tips (New + Veteran Techs)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Take a photo of wiring before moving anything.</li>
    <li>Tighten and re-check all replaced terminals—comeback prevention 101.</li>
    <li>Don’t condemn a board until inputs, grounds, and safeties are verified.</li>
    <li>Record before/after readings in notes: volts, amps, µF, and call path status.</li>
    <li>If electrical symptom appears with airflow/refrigerant symptoms, solve systemically—not component by component.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Closeout Data to Log</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Line voltage and control voltage readings</li>
    <li>Capacitor measured µF (old/new)</li>
    <li>Amp draw (compressor/fans/blower as applicable)</li>
    <li>Failed component + confirming test result</li>
    <li>Post-repair run verification (cool/heat confirmed)</li>
</ul>
